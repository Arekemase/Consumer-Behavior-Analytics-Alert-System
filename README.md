# Consumer-Behavior-Analytics-Alert-System

## Overview:
This project focuses on informing the gap between macroeconomic trends and consumer behavior. By leveraging data-driven insights, the goal is to analyze how consumers respond to changes in the Economic Consumption Index (ECI) and develop a real-time alert system to monitor and evaluate the performance of individual indices. Such a system can provide actionable insights to businesses, policymakers, and researchers for strategic decision-making.

## Key Features:

1) Data Analysis & Pattern Recognition:

  Use statistical and Moving Averages techniques to identify trends and patterns in consumer behavior.
  
  Compare each columns of Non consumable to consumable index understand behavioral shifts.
  
2) Consumption Index Monitoring:

  Integrate data sources to monitor indices in real-time.
  
  Visualize index trends through interactive ploty.
  
3) Alert System:

## Role of Moving Average Analysis:
1) Smoothing Volatility:
Economic indices can be highly volatile. A moving average provides a clearer trend by averaging fluctuations over a specified period.

2) Trend Identification:
The ploted moving averages help identify sustained economic shifts that influence long-term consumer behavior.

3) Signal Detection:
   
   .Implement thresholds of 20 and -20 on Support and Resistance respectively and anomaly detection to identify significant changes.
   .Automatically notify users of critical index performance changes.

By comparing Support and Resistance long-term moving averages, the system can detect Over heating and Under heating points with performance in economic indices.
  Implement Support and Resistance for anomaly detection to identify significant changes.

  Automatically notify users of critical index performance changes.
  
## Expected Outcomes:

1) Data-Driven Insights: Clear identification of patterns linking economic indices to consumer behaviors.

2) Automated Alerts: A functional alert system that identifies, classifies, and communicates changes in index performance.

3) Visualization Tools: Interactive dashboards for exploring real-time trends and historical analysis.

4) Strategic Utility: A solution that informs decision-making processes for businesses, marketing strategists, and policy advisors.

## Why This Matters:
This project not only showcases technical expertise in data science but also highlights my ability to apply analytics to real-world challenges. It demonstrates my understanding of macroeconomic dynamics and how to derive actionable insights that bridge technical analysis with practical application.
